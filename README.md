# Zoo-Authentication-Program
Zoo Authentication Program - Intro to Java Final

I recently completed an Intro to Java course and the final project was to create an authentication system for a zoo.
The text files were given files as well as the message digest code.
Within the main class, there are several methods the program uses to complete its task, including passing arguements through the
message digest class to return a password hash.

The main class also includes documentation and comments to further explain the code. My intentions are to help future students
taking an Intro to Java course, but I hope you use this to guide you (in lieu of copy and pasting). Each program made can be unique
to the developer writing the code, and I hope you create your own!

As for me, I am curious if in the future I return back to this project and make additions or improvements based on new
Java knowledge. This was my first exposure to Java and the project is a result of 8 weeks of learning Java with my class.

Thanks for reading!
